	<h2 id="reach">Automatically reading biomedical papers</h2>

	<p><span class="newthought">A stunning amount of work</span> has been done on biochemical reactions, literally millions of experiments costing billions of dollars. These experiments produce little pieces to much large puzzles, such as that of how cancer develops, and how drugs interact with the pathways to cancer. Unfortunately, this knowledge is not in a unified database that you could do statistical inference over, but rather spread out over millions of journal articles using inconsistent technical language that requires domain-specific knowledge.</p>

	<p>
	The <span class="newthought">Reach</span> project<label for="sn-reach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="sn-reach" class="margin-toggle"/>
	<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://github.com/clulab/reach" target="_blank"><span class="newthought">Reach</span></a> on Github.</span>
	is a system that uses hand-written rules to extract entities and events from text automatically, using a rule-based language for information extraction called Odin.<label for="sn-odin" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="sn-reach" class="margin-toggle"/>
	<span class="sidenote">Odin is part of <a href="https://github.com/clulab/processors" target="_blank">Processors</a>, an open-source library of Natural Language Processing tools on Github.</span> Because the rules are hand-written, it is easy to interpret how you got a certain result, and relatively easy to debug. You can explore the results of our work or try out your own sentences at the <a href="http://agathon.sista.arizona.edu:8080/odinweb/" target="_blank"><span class="newthought">Reach</span></a> project site.</p>

	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding" target="_blank">Binding</a> is one of the many kinds of biochemical reactions. It&rsquo;s when two proteins stick together to make a complex protein.</span> resulting in a complex of Raf and Ras. By building lots of this little links like this one, and linking those in turn (again, using text as our guide), we will make much larger directed graphs that are closer to what we want.

	<h2 id="t4f">The language of food on Twitter</h2>
	
	<p><span class="newthought">Social media sites are treasure troves</span> of information about their users being updated by the minute. The social media sites themselves are leveraging this information constantly to improve the effectiveness of marketing to users, but the same data can be used for a wide variety of applications, including public health. Colleagues at the University of Arizona and I use the language of food in a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/twitter4food/" target="_blank">project</a> to predict demographic data including obesity rate, rate of diabetes, political party, and geographical location (city and state).</p>

	Age-corrected obesity rates in US adults according to 
	<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_adult_11_12/obesity_adult_11_12.htm" target="_blank">CDC data</a>, with diabetes prevalence also from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/prev/national/figpersons.htm" target="_blank">CDC</a> divided over US Census data (<a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/pre-1980/index.html" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/intercensal/national/index.html" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/intercensal/national/nat2010.html" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/totals/2014/index.html" target="_blank">4</a>). Here, overweight means a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/" target="_blank">Body Mass Index (BMI)</a> &ge; 25.0, and obese &ge; 30.0. Although Body Mass Index is not a direct measure of fatness or of healthiness, it is very simple to collect, and does correlate with risk for health problems.
	</span>
	Obesity and related health problems such as Type II Diabetes are epidemic in the United States.
